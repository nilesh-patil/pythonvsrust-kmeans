# pythonvsrust-kmeans

A comparative study of K-Means clustering implementations written in pure Python, Rust and scikit-learn.  
The repository is structured so that you can generate synthetic data, run each implementation under identical scenarios, capture execution metrics and visualise the results.

Random init converges slowly when two centroids start in the same blob (right). k-means++ usually picks one centroid per blob on the first try (middle), converging in 2–3 iterations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) for dependency management, which provides a reproducible environment across different machines.

1. **Install Pixi** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pythonvsrust-kmeans.git
   cd pythonvsrust-kmeans
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pixi install
   ```

### Running the benchmarks

1. **Generate synthetic datasets**:
   ```bash
   pixi run python src/generate_data.py
   ```

2. **Run the full benchmark suite**:
   ```bash
   pixi run python runner.py
   ```

3. **View results**:
   Results are saved in the `results/` directory as CSV files and visualization plots.

### Using Pixi Tasks (Recommended)

The project includes pre-defined pixi tasks that streamline common workflows:

#### Quick Start
```bash
# Run everything with one command (build Rust, generate data, run benchmarks)
pixi run run-all

# Or for a quick test with smaller datasets
pixi run run-quick
```

#### Data Generation
```bash
pixi run generate-data      # Generate all default datasets
pixi run generate-small     # Small dataset (1K samples)
pixi run generate-medium    # Medium dataset (10K samples)
pixi run generate-large     # Large dataset (100K samples)
```

#### Building
```bash
pixi run build-rust         # Build Rust implementation (release mode)
pixi run build-rust-debug   # Build Rust implementation (debug mode)
```

#### Testing Individual Implementations
```bash
pixi run test-python        # Test Python implementation
pixi run test-rust          # Test Rust implementation
pixi run test-sklearn       # Test scikit-learn implementation
```

#### Benchmarking
```bash
pixi run benchmark          # Run default benchmark suite
pixi run benchmark-quick    # Quick benchmark with fewer parameters
pixi run benchmark-full     # Comprehensive benchmark (takes longer)
```

#### Utilities
```bash
pixi run clean-data         # Remove generated datasets
pixi run clean-results      # Remove benchmark results
pixi run clean-all          # Clean everything
```

#### Help
```bash
pixi run help               # List available pixi tasks
```

## 🎯 Project goal

K-Means is one of the most widely-used clustering algorithms but its performance profile can vary dramatically depending on implementation language, data layout and compilation strategy.  The aim of this project is therefore **to quantify how a hand-rolled Python implementation, a high-performance Rust implementation and the industrial-strength scikit-learn implementation behave under a matrix of realistic workloads**.

The comparison focuses on three axes:

1. **Runtime** – wall-clock time spent in the `fit` phase.
2. **Memory usage** – peak resident set size (RSS) while clustering.
3. **Result quality** – inertia / within-cluster sum-of-squares to ensure all variants reach comparable minima.

By systematically sweeping through different dataset sizes (\(10^3\) – \(10^6\) samples), dimensionalities (2 – 128 features) and cluster counts (2 – 64), I hope to surface the trade-offs that practitioners can expect in production.

## 🛠️ Implementation strategy

1. **Synthetic data generation**  
   A single source of truth (`src/generate_data.py`) produces repeatable Gaussian blobs so that each implementation receives identical input.  Datasets are cached under `data/` using a hashed filename that encodes `n_samples`, `n_features` and `n_clusters`.

2. **Algorithm implementations**
   * **Pure Python (`src/python_impl/kmeans.py`)** – A straightforward NumPy-based reference that mirrors the textbook algorithm with no low-level optimisations. Serves as the baseline. Can be run as a CLI tool.
   * **Rust (`src/rust_impl`)** – Simplified implementation in `rust` and compiled to a CLI tool that accepts the dataset path, output path to save and max n-clusters to run clustering. The binary is called from Python via `subprocess` so that timing/memory are captured from the shell. Build with `cargo build --release` in the `src/rust_impl/target/release` directory.
   * **scikit-learn (`src/sklearn_impl/kmeans.py`)** – A thin wrapper that delegates to `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`, providing a mature C-accelerated yardstick. Also executable as a CLI tool.

3. **Benchmark harness (`runner.py`)**
   * Parses experiment parameters (either CLI flags or pre-defined defaults).
   * Ensures the necessary datasets exist, generating them on the fly if required.
   * Executes each implementation in isolation while recording runtime with Python's `time.perf_counter` and memory with `psutil.Process.memory_info`.
   * Emits a `.csv` per scenario into `results/` containing metrics for each language variant.
   * Rusn a basic comparative analysis using these metrics and visualizes them.

4. **Analysis notebooks** [to-do] 
   The `notebooks/` directory contains exploratory notebooks that pivot/plot the raw results – e.g. runtime vs. sample count log-log plots, memory heatmaps, silhouette scores, etc.

## 📦 Dependencies

The project uses Pixi for dependency management, which handles both Python and Rust toolchains. Key dependencies include:

- **Python 3.11**: Core language runtime
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data manipulation and numerical computing
- **scikit-learn**: Reference K-Means implementation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization
- **Rust toolchain**: For compiling the Rust implementation
- **psutil**: Process monitoring for memory usage tracking

All dependencies are specified in `pixi.toml` and locked in `pixi.lock` for reproducibility.
